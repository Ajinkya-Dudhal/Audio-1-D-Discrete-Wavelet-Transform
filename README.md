# Audio-1-D-Discrete-Wavelet-Transform
Generalized Python code for the Audio(1-D) signal Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) is implemented without in-built function is here.

1-D DWT
1. Take ‘sample_signal.wav’ as input.
2. Decompose it with two level decomposition levels.
3. Plot the low (L) and high (H) decomposition of input signal at second
    decomposition level.
